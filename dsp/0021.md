# Loading Parcel Content

## Introduction

This document proposes a solution to what should be the process to load parcel scenes into the Decentraland client. This involves a number of processes:

* Coordinates to content resolution: Determine what is the latest authorized content for a particular parcel
* Incentives for content storage and bandwidth
* User experience, optimizations and showing partial progress
* Failure modes and error recovery

## Content Location Resolution 

Move to a DHT (IPNS) in order to identify what is the latest signed information for a parcel. This means, that there's no on-chain record of what is the current content that should be displayed on the parcel

The resolution of this DHT could be helped by some on-chain indicator of where to find this (an IP address or some other indication of how to create a connection). 

There is a server, which we call "content-server" that is intended to provide a gateway into a better way to store content, more centralized, but in a way that can be copied and pasted. This means that one can make a mirror of this centralized gateway.

The centralized gateway is compatible with IPFS. And stores the data on disk or on S3.

2. On multiplexing scene.json files into different versions

If one has a scene.json for parcel A, there's a problem that we can't deploy into parcel B because if my address is what's making the reference then there's a problem with DHT nodes dropping the previous message.

We need to do a multiplexation of the scene.json data

3. Showing progress

We need to set up a number of assets that are mandatory to download before the scene is rendered. this allows the client to show a "progress bar" of what is getting downloaded.

This is a field on the scene.json. By default, it should be assumed that all the files in the root folder should be downloaded, so that parcel developers pay a penality for trying to create a scene that has too many files or weights too much,  and they should look for an specification of how to improve this performance.

Then, there's  resolution and we should provide a "download manager" that can hint that we sahould be prfetching some data. This would be a nice to have for scripts to handle cache invalidation.

We should be cautious about how many megabytes can one download into the client. I don't think it's too many.

## Sequence

The client should:

1. Get the following on-chain information for a parcel:
a. Who is the owner?
b. Who is the updateOperator?

2. Ask the DHT or content server "what's the latest info for this owner and updateOperator"

3. Demultiplex from this latest info the parcel.json for a particular parcel

4. From the parcel.json, create a mapping from CID to IPFS addresses

5. Look into the "prefetch" field of the scene.json
a. If no "prefetch" field, then download all the assets inside the content folder
b. If there's a prefetch field, download only the assets on the prefetch field

6. When all the prefetch assets are downloaded, start running the main script

7. As required by the script, download new assets. It would be great to penalize scenes from the client for doing abrupt requests, like trying to render a model that hasn't been prefetched.
