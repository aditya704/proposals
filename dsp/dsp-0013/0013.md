## Introduction

Every [LAND](https://docs.decentraland.org/decentraland/faq/#what-is-land) and Estate in Decentraland can be exchanged for MANA by an smart contract which provides the ability to do a trustless and transparent atomic swap.

## Abstract

Digital assets (Non fungible tokens) can be traded in exchange of MANA to increase the Decentraland economy.

Within this marketplace, new users will be part of the Decentraland ecosystem and can use their MANA to buy any token which follow the [ERC721 Ethereum standard](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-721.md).

The Marketplace v2 contract exists within a EVM blockchain (currently Ethereum).

This document describes the structure, and the expected behavior and functionality of interacting components provided by the Marketplace v2 contract also known as the Marketplace contract.

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 8174](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8174) when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

## Motivation

The [marketplace v1](../dsp-0012/0012.md) supports LAND as the only NFT to be traded.

The massive creation of NFTs and the need to have them around Decentraland force us to have a place to trade them by MANA.

## Compatibility

The Marketplace v2 contract is compatible with token which follows the [ERC721 Ethereum standard](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-721.md) and the [MANA token](https://etherscan.io/address/0x0f5d2fb29fb7d3cfee444a200298f468908cc942).

Its implementation could be find [here](https://etherscan.io/address/0xb3bca6f5052c7e24726b44da7403b56a8a1b98f8#code).

## Terminology

**Order**: NFT listing. Every order has its unique id generated by the block timestamp, NFT owner, id and the price.

**Asset**: NFT token which follows the ERC721 Ethereum standard.

**Composable Asset**: @TODO:

**Legacy NFT**: NFT token supported on the [marketplace v1](../dsp-0012/0012.md).

**Account**: an Ethereum address.

## Design

### Contract

This contract is upgradable, owneable and pausable.

It accepts only tokens which follows the [ERC721 Ethereum standard](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-721.md) for listing and the [MANA token](https://etherscan.io/address/0x0f5d2fb29fb7d3cfee444a200298f468908cc942) for buying.

The MANA contract is set at the contract creation stage.

The contract also needs to be created with a `legacyNFTAddress`. This address is for the [LAND token](../dsp-0010/0010.md) originally accepted by the marketplace v1 to continue supporting its methods.

The upgradability feature was dropped to a self-destructed contract which means that nobody can upgrade it.

#### Owneable

The contract has an owner called [contract owner](#contract-owner) which play as an admin. He can transfer its ownership, pause and unpause the contract.

#### Pausable

The contract can stop accepting, cancelling and executing orders. The pause functionality can be accionable only by the [contract owner](#contract-owner).

### Roles

#### Contract owner

The account owner of the Marketplace v1 contract.

## Specification

### Events

  address nftAddress,
  uint256 priceInWei,
  uint256 expiresAt
)
```

```

**AuctionCreated**

)
```
